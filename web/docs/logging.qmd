## Logging

We use [loguru](https://loguru.readthedocs.io/) for logging.

The following environment variables exist (default value is bold):

```
ZoomyLog=["**Default**", "File"]
ZoomyLogLevel=["DEBUG", "**INFO**", "WARNING", "ERROR"]
```

Per **default**, the file is written standard output. 

If the log file is written to **file**, the filepath is set to `logs/log.log`. The configuration can be changed in `library/misc/logger_config.py`.
