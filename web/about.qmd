## Development

Zoomy is developed at [MBD](https://www.mbd.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/qamyz/?lidx=1), the group of [Julia Kowalski](https://www.mbd.rwth-aachen.de/cms/mbd/der-lehrstuhl/team/~qashd/julia-kowalski/?allou=1&lidx=1) at the RWTH Aachen University. 

The project was kicked-off during the PhD project of [Ingo Steldermann](https://shallowflow.com/about.html).
