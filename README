## Installation

1. Clone the meshes folder
```
git clone https://git-ce.rwth-aachen.de/ingo.steldermann/sfs-gmsh
```

2. Rename the meshes folder
```
mv shs-gmsh meshes
```

3. Ensure that you have a running version of PETSc. Change the environment path in to PETSc and this project folder in the `environment.yml`. You need to change the following lines
```
  PETSC_DIR: '/home/ingo/petsc'
  PETSC_ARCH: 'linux-gnu'
  SMS: '/home/ingo/Git/SMM/shallow-moments-simulation'
  PYTHONPATH: ':/home/ingo/Git/SMM/shallow-moments-simulation'
```

4. Install the conda environment

5. activate the environment
```
conda activate sms
```

6. Play around with `index.ipynb` or the testcases in `tests/simulations/test_smm.py`

The output is written as vtk files in `output/<output_dir of the simulation>` and can be opened with paraview.
